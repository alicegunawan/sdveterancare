The Veterans Health Administration uses a comprehensive performance improvement tool called Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning (SAIL) that includes key metrics used by the private sector as well as additional metrics that are important for addressing access to care, quality of mental health care, employee perception about the organization, nursing turnover and efficiency. The metrics are organized into 9 Quality domains and one Efficiency domain.  The Quality domains are combined to represent overall Quality. Each VA medical center is assessed for overall Quality from two perspectives: Relative Performance compared to other VA medical centers using a Star rating system from 1 to 5 and Improvement compared to its own performance from the past year.  Both relative performance and size of improvement are used to focus improve efforts.

SAIL is designed to include actionable metrics that are important to assess healthcare delivery and quality.  However, many of these metrics are not publicly reported by other hospitals and systems.  Therefore, it is not appropriate to directly compare evaluation findings derived from SAIL with other systems published by public and private sectors.  Instead, SAIL is developed for the VA to drive internal system-wide improvement.
